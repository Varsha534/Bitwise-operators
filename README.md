# Bitwise-operators

Bitwise Operator in C
- The bitwise operators are the operators used to perform the operations on the data at the bit-level. When we perform the bitwise operations, then it is also known as bit-level programming. It consists of two digits, either 0 or 1. It is mainly used in numerical computations to make the calculations faster.

We have different types of bitwise operators in the C programming language. The following is the list of the bitwise operators:

Operator Meaning of operator
- &	Bitwise AND operator
- | Bitwise OR operator
- ^	Bitwise exclusive OR operator
- ~ One's complement operator 
- << Left shift operator
- >> Right shift operator

Bitwise AND operator
- Bitwise AND operator is denoted by the single ampersand sign (&). Two integer operands are written on both sides of the (&) operator. If the corresponding bits of both the operands are 1, then the output of the bitwise AND operation is 1; otherwise, the output would be 0.

Bitwise OR operator
- The bitwise OR operator is represented by a single vertical sign (|). Two integer operands are written on both sides of the (|) symbol. If the bit value of any of the operand is 1, then the output would be 1, otherwise 0.

Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) Operator ^
- The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by ^.
